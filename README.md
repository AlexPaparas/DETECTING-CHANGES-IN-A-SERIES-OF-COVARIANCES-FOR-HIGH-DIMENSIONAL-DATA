# DETECTING CHANGES IN A SERIES OF COVARIANCES FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA  INCORPORATING THE GENERALIZED F-MATRIX
 
This repository contains R scripts for binary segmentation and single change-point detection using different methods: Likelihood Ratio (LR), Nagao Trace (NT), and Ryan-Killick (RK). Additionally, simulation scripts are included to evaluate the performance of these methods.

Repository Structure
1. Binary Segmentation
Binary_Segmentation_All_Methods.R
The main script that sources and runs the three methods (LR, NT, RK) for binary segmentation.

Binary_Segmentation_LR.R
Implements binary segmentation using the Likelihood Ratio (LR) method.

Binary_Segmentation_NT.R
Implements binary segmentation using the Nagao Trace (NT) method.

Binary_Segmentation_RK.R
Implements binary segmentation using the Ryan-Killick (RK) method.

2. Simulations
Simulations_All_Methods.R
The main script that runs simulations to evaluate the performance of the methods.

Simulations_Likelihood_Ratio.R
Contains simulation functions for the Likelihood Ratio (LR) method.

Simulations_Nagao.R
Contains simulation functions for the Nagao Trace (NT) method.

Simulations_Ryan_Killick.R
Contains simulation functions for the Ryan-Killick (RK) method.

3. Dataset
The dataset used in the analysis is :
